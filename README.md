**Hulthen Potential**

Computational model to analytically compute the energies and approximate wavefunctions of electrons in a Hulthen screened Coulomb potential. Can be used to model various electron configurations, as different values for orbital quantum number and screening parameter can be provided. It is easy to identify the physical solutions as those corresponding to physically allowed energy levels, normalize their associated wavefunctions, and plot those normalized wavefunctions and their squares (probability densities).
