**Hulthen Potential**

Computational model to analytically compute the energies and approximate wavefunctions of electrons in a Hulthen screened Coulomb potential. Used to model various electron configurations, as different values of orbital quantum number and screening parameter can be provided, for which it is easy to filter through all physically allowed solutions (corresponding to the physically allowed energy levels and their associated wavefunctions).
